> We're stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.
> (Douglas Adams)

I hate coffee in cheap foam cups. The unsettling way it seeps through the pores (longing to escape its possibly carcinogenic confines) is a visceral reminder of the taste: stale, plastic, and hot without warmth. Don't mistake this diatribe for elitism; I'm not too proud to down a Folger's. I have a taste for a well-made Sumatran pour-over, but not a requirement for one. I recognize the reality and utility of a fast cup of coffee to get the job done: put warmth in the bones and caffeine in the bloodstream. I don't need cream, sugar, *et al*; I don't believe in depriving oneself of savor, even if it is the less pleasant bitterness of a cheap coffee, it is still a thing to be experienced. Just, don't put it in those horrid foam cups, okay?

Now that we're through that, I trust we have a better understanding.

## What is Tohuw.Net About?
My job has nothing to do with coffee, but if you're in my line of work and don't have strong opinions about things like coffee, you can't think correctly. I'm an Inside Systems Engineer at VMware for Software-Defined Storage, which is a long-winded way of saying I'm a [vSAN](http://www.vmware.com/products/virtual-san.html)/[VVOLs](http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/virtual-volumes.html) guy with less time on planes, more on web presentations and phone calls[^thatwaslongtoo]. I help people figure out how VSAN and VVOLs can help them and/or their customers.

So, you'll read a healthy dose of software-defined storage and HCI[^hci] stuff here. But I also like to think about the technical and the philosophical aspects of today's technology environments. I even more like hearing and sharing similar thoughts with others. I find we IT humans are a philosophical, overall humorous lot[^dasblinkenlights]. I think the humor comes from reconciling the infuriating duality of what seems a rigorous, scientific process sort of job with a frank realization that there's a definitely unscientific art to managing, designing, or developing these things. This happens because people are involved, and though we're sometimes reluctant to admit it, this is what makes the work actually interesting to do.

I aim to write simply, because the goal is to appeal to a wide range of technical backgrounds and skill levels. The best leaps forward in my career have been catalyzed by someone with a great deal more knowledge than me inviting me to converse, then promptly throwing me to the sharks. Ideally, I hope to spark discussions (or outrage) among enough people that I end up somewhere in the middle, with the revered technical gurus out there to catalyze me further in my learning and shark-swimming, and come across those earlier in their journey to encourage. Failing that, at least I'll have recorded some hopefully relevant stuff.

I'll write about these sort of things, and also some non-introspective chatter I'd like to share, because too much navel-gazing is bad for the neck.

## What's a Tohuw?
It's a Hebrew word that appears several times in the Bible. There's no succinct English translation. [Larry Pierce sums up the Biblical usage of *tohuw*](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8414&t=ESV) like so:

1. formlessness, confusion, unreality, emptiness
	1. formlessness (of primeval earth)
		1. nothingness, empty space
	2. that which is empty or unreal (of idols) *(fig)*
	3. wasteland, wilderness (of solitary places)
	4. place of chaos
	5. vanity

I've long used it as a moniker with the full intention of finally making a blog of the same name. The word strikes me as a meaningful comparision of the sweeping disorder, the quiet refuges, and the empty grasps at straws we face in our short lives. Technology is fascinating because it is a heartfelt expression of man's desire for order, while at the same time bringing a new and profound chaos which must be further worked out. This is no reason for despair or frustration; the price of technological progress makes it worth the cost of admission. There's always failures and detriments along the way, but optimism is the fuel for better technology, and conversation is the spark to light that fuel.

So welcome to this place of chaos, this wilderness, this *tohuw*. Let's talk.

[^thatwaslongtoo]: Okay, that's long-winded too. The truth is, I've never been too good at the whole job descriptions thing, or sticking to them. I just wanna do stuff, you know?
[^hci]: Hyper-Converged Infrastructure, a happy little buzzword mostly meaning: "make your virtualization gear do your storage work too"
[^dasblinkenlights]: I'd be remiss to not recall here "[DAS BLINKENLIGHTS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights)", which sums up the regretful kind of humor from which my profession stems.
