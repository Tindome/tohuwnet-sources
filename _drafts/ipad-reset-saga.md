#The Behavior of My iPad After Forgetting My Code

##Steps

1. Forgot Unlock Code
1. Had set up “erase after 10”
1. after 4, 1 minute wait
1. after 6, 5 minute wait
1. after 7, 15 minute wait
1. after 8, 60 minute wait, but mitigated it by restarting, made it 15 minutes
1. after 9, 60 minute wait that reset after restarting
1. connected to computer, iTunes open
1. iTunes “device is disabled due to unlock code”
1. reset with two button press
1. disable reset to 60, same msg in iTunes
1. tried erase device on icloud.com
1. device wasn’t connected due to being disabled
1. performed recovery mode with two button press until iTunes logo displayed, restore option in iTunes
1. failed, device returned to disabled screen w/fresh 60 min timeout
1. tried again, got Hello screen
1. “this device has been lost”, had to enter username/pw – FINDMYIPHONE RESET
1. completed setup, including activating apple pay card
1. very shortly after getting to home screen with loading apps, got the reset screen again
1. Hello screen came back, went through normal reset process
1. restored from iCloud backup again
1. had to reactivate Apple Pay

##Moral

findmyiphone reset will supersede anything else (probably appropriate), but other resets still happen
